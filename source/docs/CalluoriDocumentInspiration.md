I really like the design of the website because of the bold lines and high contast of the design. I really like basic black and white websites, espically when the content is so colorful. One of my favorite features is that he incorporates Ecommerce into the blog portion of his site, by strategically putting his products at the bottom of his page, so after seeing his work you don't have to go to another page to get to his shop. 

####Amazon
https://www.amazon.com/
What I like about amazon is that they have so much stuff to offer yet the website is not overly cluttered. They show you stuff that could be useful to you based on your searches, and that's super helpful 99% of the time. The one thing I really don't like about Amazon is that it isnt really a site that you can mindlessly browse on. Everything is sorted by category which is good almost all of the time, but it's hard to stumble upon a product, it's mostly just search for it and it will probably be there.

I really don't like the design of this website. The homepage is cluttered with things that don't apply to me, and there is no way to remove them to my knowledge. I would rather see an emptier screen than a screen with unnecessary information. The class pages themselves are just annoying. The design is boring and the website just feels clunky.
