				My name is Martina Calluori, in 2015 I graduated from Bethlehem Catholic High School, and went on my way to Drexel University. I got to Drexel and found very quickly that I was in a place that I have wanted to be my whole life. I am an Interactive Digital Media Major and I think choosing that major was one of the best decisions of my life. I have always had a passion for design and an interest in coding, so this major is like a match made in heaven for me.

				As mentioned before, I have always been interested in design. I have been making shirt, logo and album artwork for my friends for years, and now that I'm pretty decent I like the extra money comes with good designs. I've always been into the local music scenes throughout Pennsylvania, and through that I have discovered a few of my passions. I don't think I would be at Drexel if I had not started photographing my friends bands for fun. That passion for photography sparked a whole world of interest for me. My interest in photography brought me to having a love for photoshop, and from there I started to create things, either with my photographs or designs just from my head.

				My best friend, once he found out I could use photoshop, asked if I could make a design for his band. He needed a cool shirt design, so we sat down and thought up a great idea together, and from there I just figured out how to make it happen. At the time I had no photoshop training other than the youtube tutorials I had found online, but I had a vision and I had the passion and I made it happen. That's kind of how I approach many situations. As long as I have the motivation and the idea to do it, I usually don't stop until I figure it out.

				To know a little about my personal life, I have a dog named Bentley and he has been my best friend for 12 years. I really don't know what I would have done without him growing up. I have a mom and a dad, and two great step parents, and between the four of them they raised me. I have two step sisters between my mom and my step dad, they're 25 and 29. I've had a lot of pets in my life and never want to live without a pet. Animals are super important to me and a lot of my creativity and inspiration comes from them. Also, I have a lot of plants. I have two cacti, and 7 various succulents that I love and care for every day.
